Recently I decide to rewrite my cache system in a Node.js project. And I’d like to share the new structure of my cache system.

The new structure is designed to integrate redis with sequelize. Its strategy is simple.

Try find the key in redis.
If not found, fetch data from database, then write the data to redis and return it.
If found, directly return the data.

basic structure
What makes it different is it integrates with sequelize, the ORM.

The redis key is generated with some attributes in sequelize model.
The cache fields are defined in sequelize model.
Fetch data from database with sequelize.
Let me show you some codes.

The model in sequelize.

The proxyGetDBRecord method in cache.

Then here is how can you use it.

Enjoy it!
